# Overview

GOAT Hangman Game is an Android application written by Nicolas Pariente. It brings a different version of the common Hangman game, allowing users to play Solo or With friends, and implements the competition system as a Race.

The project was created as a learning exercise to understand Kotlin by applying it as backend logic to Jetpack-Compose UI elements.

Through this project, I learned:

- How to set Kotlin projects in Android Studio IDE
- How Jetpack-Compose components are created using declarative programming style
- How to add state tracking to UI elements using Kotlin
- How to add animation to the UI using Kotlin
- How to implement Kotlin variables, conditionals, loops, classes, and collections
